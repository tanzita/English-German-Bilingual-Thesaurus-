# English-German Bilingual Thesaurus using Lucene

In this project I built a English-German Bilingual Thesaurus. I used sqlite to create the database. I used data from dict.cc and obeyed their copyright rules. I then used Lucene to index the data. For indexing I used StandardAnalyzer. I then created document based on German word and English word and finally based on the query the searching is performed.

I made sure that indexing is done only once to perform the search operation more speedy. To make the system user friendly I created a Graphical User Interface where User can provide the input and view the output.

I have sorted the output according to the hit count of individual result.

## Conclusion

I have created this project as a indexing based search project. So in traditional sense it is not like a dictionary but more of a most important words/phrase collection of a given word/phrase.
